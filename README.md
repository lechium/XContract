XContract
=========

Xcode plugin for keeping track of contracting hours.

Features:

1. Start / Stop timer on a per project basis.
2. Auto saves every 10 minutes
3. Will automatically stop tracking when computer goes to sleep
4. Prompts to restart timer when awaken from sleep
5. Will prompt hourly to make sure you are still working on a project (can be turned off)
6. Exports hour reports to basic html table (saves as xls, but its really just HTML table with no formatting)

Future plans:

1. Improve exporting formatting
2. add ability to set hourly rates per project
3. add ability to keep track of hours that are paid / unpaid.
